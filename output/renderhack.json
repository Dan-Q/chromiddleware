      "description": "&lt;p&gt;A programmable middleware interface, powered by Headless Chrome, to produce standard machine-readable output (e.g. RSS) from SPAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a fan of the free, open, standards-compliant Web/that whole hippyish Indieweb movement, it drives me nuts when I can’t get a sensible machine readable RSS feed (or other machine-readable API) of a website, especially on JS-heavy single-page apps. Headless Chrome can fix this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to implement a framework for expressing ‘feeds’ in terms of JS code and CSS selectors, such that Headless Chrome can scrape the necessary parts of the application and expose a feed of the appropriate type. In other words, it’s a way of adding an API to a site that doesn’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;
